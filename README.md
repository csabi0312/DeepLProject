Group name: Neural Net Ninjas <br>
Group members: Emmer Marcell (DL55DP), Gedeon Máté Károly (HIIMNO), Kiss Csaba (B73BSA) <br>
Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-llm-science-exam <br> <br>
Colab Notebooks:
- main.ipynb: Main Colab Notebook for data preparation, creation of training, validation and test sets. <br>
- data_viz.ipynb: Colab Notebook for data visualization
- embedding_approach.ipynb: The main notebook for building and evaluating the model

The running of embedding_approach.ipynb is enough to both train and evaluate the main model.
