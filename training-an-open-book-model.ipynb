    "# Training a model on the open book dataset\n",
    "The second notebook of our homework contains the training process of the 'microsoft/deberta-v3-large' LLM on the open book database we created in the [context-creation][1] notebook. The entire notebook is heavily inspired from the popular competition notebook of the [Kaggle - LLM Science Exam][2], called [How To Train Open Book Model - Part 1][3]. There, [Chris Deotte][4] used a dataset containig 65k question and answer pairs with context compiled from different notebooks using e.g. gpt-3.5 turbo for data augmentation. This augmentation step was left out in our solution due to time constraints but it's an obvious choice of improvement in the future.\n",
